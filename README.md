# Automatic-Speech-Recognition

A report exploring the advancements in HMM based models for automatic speech recognition on the TIMIT spoken sentence data set. Model accuracies (inclusing deletions and insertions) vary from ~60% for GMM-HMM models to over 80% for ANN-HMM models with deep and more complex neural network architectures.
